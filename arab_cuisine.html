      <h2>Khubz</h2>
      <p>
        This is the Arabic flatbread quite like the pita that you will find throughout the region, wherever you go. It is thick and traditionally baked in a oven (tannur).

      <h2>Kefta</h2>
      <p>
        The predecessor of the Indian "kofta", the "kefta" is simply a grilled dish of ground meat, like lamb or beef. It is mildly seasoned with paprika, parsley, and sometimes onions. It is grilled like a sausage.

      <h2>Labneh</h2>
      <p>
        Yoghurt is perhaps as popular in the Arab world as in India. The labneh is a creamier version with the water drained out.
